        <p>Fried rice is a popular Asian dish made from pre-cooked rice that is stir-fried in a wok or a frying pan with ingredients

        <h3> Ingredients </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>⅔ cup chopped baby carrots</li>
            <li>½ cup frozen green peas</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced, or to taste (Optional)</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>3 cups leftover cooked and chilled white rice</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce, or more to taste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil, or to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Steps </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the vegetable oil and swirl to coat the pan.</li>

            <li>Add the chilled rice to the pan, breaking up any clumps. Stir everything together until well combined.</li>
            <li>Pour in the soy sauce and sesame oil, mixing thoroughly to ensure even distribution.</li>
            <li>Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently, until the rice is heated through.</li>
